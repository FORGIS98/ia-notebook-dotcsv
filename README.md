### IA Notebook 5
About notebook 5, we need a dataset of flowers and then apply to this dataset modifications with gimp, photoshop or whatever to remove quality, put a blur filter or modify the color contrasts and light. To reduce the quality of the image. The flower dataset can be found here: [Flower Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) and to automate photo editing you can use this script: [Generate-blurry-images-Python-code.](https://github.com/Diaz-De-Vivar/Generate-blurry-images-Python-code./blob/master/Posterizar_Distorsionar_Saturar.py).  

If you use google colab, upload the input and output flowers to your google drive account.
